## [Building a project website](https://github.com/catherinerauch/catherinerauch.github.io)

- In this assignment we built a user site with GitHub

- Use of themes and icons on a webpage was explored

##[Analysis of COVID-19 Data](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)

- In this lab we practiced data wrangling and visualization with real-time COVID-19 data
- It includes an in-depth look at daily new case data as well as cumulative data at State and County levels
- Pipes and other tidyverse tools were used to manipulate data and present it as legible tables and plots
