##### In summer 2020, I took an R based GIS course (Geography 176A - Intro to Geographic Information Systems and Science).

Here is the collection of links for completed assignments: 
<br>
<br>

## [Exploration of US city data](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-03.html)

- In this lab we explored working with sf, sfc, and sfg features & objects
- Coordinate transformations and calculations were made to visualize distances between cities and borders
- Ggplot, gghighlight, and ggrepel were used to create graphics that are clear and interesting 
<br>

## [Analysis of COVID-19 data](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)

- In this lab we practiced data wrangling and visualization with real-time COVID-19 data
- It includes an in-depth look at daily new case data as well as cumulative data at State and County levels
- Pipes and other tidyverse tools were used to manipulate data and present it as legible tables and plots
<br>

## [Building a project website](https://github.com/catherinerauch/catherinerauch.github.io)

- In this assignment we built a user site with GitHub
- It includes a default page ('About Me') and a projects page (repo with access to code) 
- Use of themes and icons on a webpage was explored
