# Hi, I'm Catherine.

</center>

`r fa("exclamation-circle")` I'm in my last year pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics and Data Science at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).  I am currently exploring a minor in Spatial Studies.

I enjoy open water swimming, dogs and riding my bike to class. I dearly miss being on Campus.

I also enjoy tailoring my projects to my interests, which include photography, traveling, marine life, and sports.
