<br>

I'm a recent graduate of the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics and Data Science and a minor in [Spatial Studies](http://spatial.ucsb.edu/academic-minor/).  

Previous work in [spatial](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog176A.html#previous-work) projects and other areas can be found [here](https://catherinerauch.github.io/projects.html). Currently, I am working on an [analysis](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog176A.html#current-work) of Killer Whale Sighting Patterns.

In my free time I travel and like to take [photos](https://vsco.co/kitcatzz/gallery). Born and raised in Northern California, I'm a big sports fan and sacredly follow the San Jose Sharks. I can also be seen out and about on my bike or pushing the limits on the track.
