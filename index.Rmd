`r library(icon)`

I'm in my last year pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics and Data Science at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).  I am currently exploring a minor in [Spatial Studies](http://spatial.ucsb.edu/academic-minor/).

***

Last summer, I took an R based GIS course (Geography 176A - Intro to Geographic Information Systems and Science). I worked on assignments that included: 

- working with raw data to create updating tables and plots that breakdown Covid Case Data

- extracting US census data  to analyzing the impacted populations at the US border zone 

- completing a dam analysis to examine dam patterns in the US

- implementing remote sensing based flood analysis

- constructing a partial FIM library

More info can be found [here](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog176A.html).


I am looking forward to using the skills learned in this class, including collecting and cleaning raw data, vector/raster data manipulation, creating/joining spatial data and objects, and geographical focused visualizations and tables, to create more spatial projects. Currently, I am using these newly learned skills to examine Oregon Wildfire Data.

In my free time I travel and like to take [photos](https://vsco.co/catttrauc/gallery). Born and raised in Northern California, I'm a big sports fan and religiously follow the San Jose Sharks. But, I can also be spotted at Warriors and Giants games.

I enjoy tailoring my projects to my interests, take a [look](https://catherinerauch.github.io/projects.html)!
