##### I'm in my last year pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics and Data Science and a minor in [Spatial Studies](http://spatial.ucsb.edu/academic-minor/) at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).  


##### [Currently](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog176A.html#current-work), I am working on an analysis of Killer Whale Sighting Patterns.

##### Previous work in [spatial](https://catherinerauch.github.io/geog176A.html#previous-work) projects and other areas can be found [here](https://catherinerauch.github.io/projects.html)

In my free time I travel and like to take [photos](https://vsco.co/catttrauc/gallery).

Born and raised in Northern California, I'm a big sports fan and religiously follow the San Jose Sharks. But, I can also be spotted at Warriors and Giants games.
