In my free time I explore the world and like to take [photos](https://vsco.co/kitcatzz/gallery). Born and raised in Northern California, I'm a big sports fan and religiously follow the San Jose Sharks. I can also be seen out and about on my bike or pushing the limits on the track. And I'm always looking to tailor my projects to my interests.
