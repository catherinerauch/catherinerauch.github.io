</center>
I'm in my last year pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics and Data Science at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).  I am currently exploring a minor in [Spatial Studies](http://spatial.ucsb.edu/academic-minor/).

In my free time, I moonlight as an amateur photographer and travel photographing landscapes and marine life.

knitr::include_graphics(c("img/OsakaCastle.jpg","img/JapaneseMaple.jpg"))
``` 

Born and raised in Northern California, I'm a big sports fan and religiously follow the San Jose Sharks. But, I can also be spotted at Warriors and Giants games.

I enjoy open water swimming and tailoring my projects to my interests, take a [look](https://catherinerauch.github.io/projects.html)!

#### I also enjoy tailoring my projects to my interests, which include photography, traveling, marine life, and sports.

#### I enjoy open water swimming, dogs and riding my bike to class. I dearly miss being on Campus.
