<br>

I'm in my last year pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics and Data Science at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).  I am currently exploring a minor in [Spatial Studies](http://spatial.ucsb.edu/academic-minor/).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%",out.height="20%",fig.cap="   ",fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/OsakaCastle.jpg","img/JapaneseMaple.jpg"))
``` 
In my free time I travel and like to take [photos](https://vsco.co/catttrauc/gallery). Born and raised in Northern California, I'm a big sports fan and religiously follow the San Jose Sharks. But, I can also be spotted at Warriors and Giants games.

I enjoy tailoring my projects to my interests, take a [look](https://catherinerauch.github.io/projects.html)!
